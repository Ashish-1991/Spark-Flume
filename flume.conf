# The configuration file needs to define the sources, 
# the channels and the sinks.
# Sources, channels and sinks are defined per agent, 
# in this case called 'agent'

#Define all source,channel and sink
agent.sources = so1
agent.channels = ch1
agent.sinks = si1

# For each one of the sources, the type is defined
#Source properties

agent.sources.so1.type = netcat

agent.sources.so1.channel=ch1

# The channel can be defined as follows.
#Channel properties
agent.channels.ch1.type = memory
agent.channels.ch1.capacity = 1000
agent.channels.ch1.transactionCapacity = 100



# Each sink's type must be defined
#Sink properties

# Other config values specific to each type of channel(sink or source)
# can be defined as well
# In this case, it specifies the capacity of the memory channel
